# Birdly by Caain√£ Jeronimo de Souza Nascimento

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with
`Typescript`, `Redux`, `Luxon` and `Tailwind`.

## Instalation

In the project directory to install the dependencies, you can run:

### `npm install`

## Run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best
performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

## How it works

Birdly is a Twitter like app.

I've set up a redux environment to act as the API. The first time that you open
the app, some fake data is generated to fill the app with users and posts.

The intention is focus only in the front-end work.

You can reset the database by simply clearing the local storage in the
application tab in the debug panel.

This is a work-in-progress project.
